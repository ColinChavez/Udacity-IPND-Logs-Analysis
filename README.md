# Description
>Your task is to create a reporting tool that prints out reports (in plain text) based on the data in the database. This reporting tool is a Python program using the psycopg2 module to connect to the database.

So what are we reporting, anyway?
Here are the questions the reporting tool should answer. The example answers given aren't the right ones, though!

>1. What are the most popular three articles of all time? Which articles have been accessed the most? Present this information as a sorted list with the most popular article at the top.

Example:

"Princess Shellfish Marries Prince Handsome" — 1201 views
"Baltimore Ravens Defeat Rhode Island Shoggoths" — 915 views
"Political Scandal Ends In Political Scandal" — 553 views

>2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? That is, when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views? Present this as a sorted list with the most popular author at the top.

Example:

Ursula La Multa — 2304 views
Rudolf von Treppenwitz — 1985 views
Markoff Chaney — 1723 views
Anonymous Contributor — 1023 views

>3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors? The log table includes a column status that indicates the HTTP status code that the news site sent to the user's browser. (Refer to this lesson for more information about the idea of HTTP status codes.)

Example:

July 29, 2016 — 2.5% errors

# Good coding practices
**SQL** style
Each one of these questions can be answered with a single database query. Your code should get the database to do the heavy lifting by using joins, aggregations, and the where clause to extract just the information you need, doing minimal "post-processing" in the Python code itself.

**Python** code quality
Your code should be written with good Python style. The PEP8 style guide is an excellent standard to follow. You can do a quick check using the pep8 command-line tool.

# Download Software

1.**Install VirtualBox**. 
VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the virtual machine. You can download it from [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1). Install the platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that.

**Ubuntu users:** If you are running Ubuntu 14.04, install VirtualBox using the Ubuntu Software Center instead. Due to a reported bug, installing VirtualBox from the site may uninstall other software you need.

2.**Install Vagrant**. 
Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem. Download it from [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). Install the version for your operating system.

**Windows users:** The Installer may ask you to grant network permissions to Vagrant or make a firewall exception. Be sure to allow this.

3.**Download the VM Configuration**
Download the zip file: [FSND-Virtual-Machine.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5acfbfa3_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip) This will give you a directory called FSND-Virtual-Machine. It may be located inside your Downloads folder.

**Note:** If you are using Windows OS you will find a Time Out error, to fix it use the new Vagrant file configuration to replace you current Vagrant file.

Alternately, you can use Github to fork and clone the repository https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.

Either way, you will end up with a new directory containing the VM files. Change to this directory in your terminal with **```cd```**. Inside, you will find another directory called **```/vagrant```**. Change directory to the **```/vagrant```** directory:

4.**Start the Virtual Machine**
From your terminal, inside the vagrant subdirectory, run the command **```vagrant up```**. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is. When **```vagrant up```** is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run **```vagrant ssh```** to log in to your newly installed Linux VM!

Inside the VM, change directory to **```/vagrant```** and look around with **```ls```**.

The files you see here are the same as the ones in the vagrant subdirectory on your computer (where you started Vagrant from). Any file you create in one will be automatically shared to the other. This means that you can edit code in your favorite text editor, and run it inside the VM.

Files in the VM's **```/vagrant directory```** are shared with the vagrant folder on your computer. But other data inside the VM is not. For instance, the PostgreSQL database itself lives only inside the VM.

# Run the Program
Download the [required files](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip). You will need to unzip this file after downloading it. The file inside is called **```newsdata.sql```**. Put this file into the **```/vagrant```** directory, which is shared with your virtual machine.


To load the data, **```cd```** into the **```/vagrant```** directory and use the command **```psql -d news -f newsdata.sql```**.
Here's what this command does:

* **```psql```** — the PostgreSQL command line program
* **```-d news ```**— connect to the database named news which has been set up for you
* **```-f newsdata.sql```** — run the **SQL** statements in the file **```newsdata.sql```**
Running this command will connect to your installed database server and execute the SQL commands in the downloaded file, creating tables and populating them with data.**THIS COMMAND ONLY NEEDS TO BE RUN ONCE!**
# Please Create the following Views:
```
Question 1:

CREATE VIEW popular_articles AS
SELECT a.title articles, count(l.path) AS views
FROM log l
JOIN articles a
ON l.path = concat('/article/', a.slug)
GROUP BY articles
ORDER BY views desc
limit 3;

Question 2:

CREATE VIEW popular_authors AS
SELECT au.name AS authors, count(l.path) as views
FROM log l
JOIN articles a
ON l.path = concat('/article/', a.slug)
JOIN authors au
ON au.id = a.author 
GROUP BY au.name
ORDER BY views desc;

Question 3:

CREATE VIEW requests AS
SELECT date(time) date, count(*) AS views
FROM log 
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY views;

CREATE VIEW errors AS
SELECT date(time) date, count(*) AS errors
FROM log 
WHERE status != '200 OK'
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY errors;

CREATE VIEW max_errors AS
SELECT requests.date, round((100.0 * errors.errors)/requests.views,3) as percent
FROM requests
JOIN errors
ON errors.date = requests.date
GROUP BY requests.date, errors.errors, requests.views
ORDER BY percent desc;
```
